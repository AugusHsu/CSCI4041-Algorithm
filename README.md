# CSCI4041-Algorithm

##Introduction

This is the repo that contains all porgramming assignments as well as other materials for CSCI4041 Algorithm course spring 2019 at the University of Minnesota.

I create this repo to archive my previous coursework and may also help those friends who intend to study undergraduate level algorithms.

CSCI 2041 Ocaml programming and CSCI4511W Artifical Intelligence will be shared later.
